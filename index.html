                There are several types of plants, including flowering plants, non-flowering plants, trees, shrubs, herbs, and climbers. Some plants are small and soft like herbs, while others like trees are tall and woody. Each type has different characteristics based on its structure, habitat, and purpose.

                The plant kingdom, known as Kingdom Plantae, includes various groups such as algae, mosses, ferns, gymnosperms, and angiosperms. These groups are classified based on their body structure, reproduction method, and the presence or absence of seeds and flowers.
